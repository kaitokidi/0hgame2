OMG SO SWEET

I started this project on October 25th 2015 at 02:00am, and finished it on October 25th 2015 at 02:00am Amazing isn't it? a game made with no time? yup! enjoy it! (for those who are asceptical about it, http://0hgame.eu/)

The rules:

1- Check me out, Check me out, I'm not a raper.

2- WALK ONLY THROUGH WHITE GROUND, AVOID ANYTHING ELSE

3- Try to reach the BLUE sea on the end of the level with your crew

4- Enjoy it. (it is a rule, so if you are not enjoying the game is because you are not following the rules)

I made the game using the game of the last year : https://github.com/kaitokidi/0hgame

To use it, you will need SFML libs. If you need to install them For Windows, in Visual studio (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php) for Linux users (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-linux.php), and for MAC OS (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-osx.php) .
